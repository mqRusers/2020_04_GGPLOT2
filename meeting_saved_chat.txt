14:49:56	 From  Akhil puppala : okay
14:55:17	 From  Richard Miller - Helper : the little broom deletes them all
14:59:47	 From  Stephanie Deering : Is there a way to specify colours per data group?
15:00:54	 From  Stephanie Deering : ok cool thanks :) sorry to jump ahead
15:02:58	 From  Richard Miller - Helper : ggplot(data = PlotDat, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, colour = amFac)) + geom_point() + scale_color_manual(values = c('red', 'blue'))
15:03:24	 From  Stephanie Deering : awesome thank you
15:07:09	 From  Richard Miller - Helper : is colour and color the same thing ?
15:11:49	 From  Rosanne Abrahamse : is it possible to use the shape to put in the actual values from your data next to the points?
15:13:06	 From  Rosanne Abrahamse : okay thanks!
15:13:59	 From  Jon Mifsud : I know there is a package that allows you to add the signif points, I haven't used it though! ggsignif
15:22:49	 From  Stephanie Deering : Im getting an error with that line
15:23:29	 From  Stephanie Deering : yep that's worked with the fun.y
15:25:28	 From  Rosanne Abrahamse : ive seen 'stat' = identity quite a few times, what does that mean?
15:28:36	 From  Jon Mifsud : my understanding is that stat() function tells ggplot2 that you want to use aesthetics produced by a statistic 
15:45:35	 From  Hector Pacheco : I don't have ggthemes
16:02:42	 From  Elizabeth Seil : excellent, many thanks
16:02:50	 From  Tanya Rosewarne : Thank you!
